                â€œNeurofeedback should play a major therapeutic role in many difficult areas. In my opinion,
                if any medication had demonstrated such a wide spectrum of efficacy it would be universally
                accepted and widely used.'

                After your free, personal consultation, we begin with an initial assessment that will indicate
                what areas of your brain need to be strengthened. From there, we will customize our approach to
                meet your specific, individual needs through a variety of treatment interventions and support
                protocols to augment the neurofeedback therapy including individual counseling and coaching,
                nutritional and supplement support, and any cutting edge therapies we might also find helpful.
