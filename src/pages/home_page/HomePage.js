                â€œNeurofeedback should play a major therapeutic role in many difficult areas. In my opinion,

                After your free, personal consultation, we begin with an initial assessment that will indicate
                what areas of your brain need to be strengthened. From there, we will customize our approach to 
                meet your specific, individual needs through a variety of treatment interventions and support 
                protocols to augment the neurofeedback therapy including individual counseling, cognitive therapy, 
                anxiety and trauma therapy, nutritional and supplement support, and any cutting edge therapies we
                might also find helpful.
