If the stressful\\\r\n        trigger of the headache continues, the response becomes chronic. Once ongoing, it is harder\\\r\n        and harder for your brain to re-regulate or normalize function. Headaches can be triggered\\\r\n        due to many factors; ranging from hormonal imbalance, light sensitivity, allergies and dehydration\\\r\n        to neuro-metabolic issues.
