From mental stress and negative moods to fear, guilt and shame, the emotional toll impacts daily\\n        lives, careers and relationships. As a result, most people who suffer from post trauma are looking for\\n        an effective way to treat their symptoms so they can get back to living a normal life. Unfortunately,\\n        many sufferers experience only limited benefit after trying various therapies and medication. Post trauma\\n        is a disorder based in the brain. With post trauma, a severe stress response is triggered, the challenge\\n        is to teach the brain to turn off the stress response. Research shows that the traumatic stress experienced\\n        by those suffering from post trauma has a lasting change on the brain. It affects the amygdala involved in\\n        emotional memory, the hippocampus responsible for long term memory, and prefrontal cortex which modulates\\n        emotion. Each of these centers change, negatively impacting brainwave function. Current treatment options\\n        include talk therapy and medication but each have their limitations. Talk therapy can take a very long time\\n        to resolve the trauma as many suffers aren't always aware of the trauma. Medication comes with many side\\n        effects and is unable to restore healthy brainwave function.\"},{icon:faHeartPulse,heading:'Mental Stress',subheading:'How does mental stress affect my brain?',content:\"Due to our environment and the ongoing stressors impacting the body every second of every\\n        day, the body can become overloaded and our brainwaves can become abnormal. This most\\n        commonly occurs as a result of overstimulation. This irregularity, often found in people\\n        suffering with mental stress can create abnormal responses to incoming stimuli. Neurofeedback\\n        is shown to normalize brainwaves.\"},{icon:faCloudShowersHeavy,heading:'Negative Moods',subheading:'Are you struggling with the symptoms of negative moods?',content:\"If you have been struggling with negative moods, you're not alone. More than 19 million adults\\n        suffer from negative moods. If you are feeling overwhelmed, worn down, fatigued, sad, isolated,\\n        foggy brained, or disconnected, these are classic signs and symptoms that accompany negative moods.\\n        Research at Keck Imaging Labs at the University of Wisconsin shows that negative mood people\\n        experience a reduction of activity in the left side of the brain. This is the side responsible for\\n        engaging in positive moods.

Attention and focus problems can cause anger outbursts, difficulty completing\\n        tasks, restlessness and the inability to socially engage or connect.\"},{icon:faGears,heading:'Sleep Issues',subheading:'Why am I tired all of the time?',content:\"Until recently, sleep issues were studied from a behavioral perspective, but as this\\n        problem grows, new research and insights have been discovered. Recent studies suggest that in\\n        cases of sleep issues, the brain is unable to process information properly due to cortical\\n        hyperarousal. This creates abnormal brainwave function. Sleeping issues can disrupt daily life\\n        by causing irritability, exhaustion, tiredness, and difficulty staying focused. If being tired\\n        all of the time isn't bad enough, this affliction is also believed to be a risk factor for other\\n        diseases, including obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Chronic, or recurrent,\\n        sleep issues are a widespread condition affecting nearly 10-15% of the global population. The longer\\n        you struggle with this, the harder it becomes to treat. That's why it's important to learn how to deal\\n        with sleep issues as soon as symptoms present themselves and to seek medical attention for evaluation\\n        and diagnosis as early as possible.\"},{icon:faLightbulb,heading:'Memory',subheading:'Do you struggle with symptoms of memory loss?',content:\"If you are beginning to notice the signs of brain fog, forgetfulness, declining cognitive function,\\n        mixing up your words, asking the same questions repeatedly or taking longer to perform normal tasks, these\\n        are all signs and symptoms of memory loss.

If the stressful\\n        trigger of the headache continues, the response becomes chronic. Once ongoing, it is harder\\n        and harder for your brain to re-regulate or normalize function. Headaches can be triggered\\n        due to many factors; ranging from hormonal imbalance, light sensitivity, allergies and dehydration\\n        to neuro-metabolic issues.
