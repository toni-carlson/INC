This puts you in the driver's seat of reclaiming\r\n            and optimizing your health. Your brain is not hard-wired, it is not limited or fixed in it's\r\n            abilities to heal. When the imbalance is removed and brainwaves are regulated, cognitive function\r\n            improves. The result is an improved ability to remember.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className='cards-container'>\r\n          {\r\n            whoWeHelpInfo.map((info, index) =>\r\n              <ExpandableSection\r\n                key={index}\r\n                id={`section-${index}`}\r\n                heading={info.heading}\r\n                subheading={info.subheading}\r\n                children={info.content}\r\n              />\r\n            )\r\n          }\r\n        </div>\r\n      </FrameLayout>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default WhoWeHelp;\r\n"],"mappings":";;AAAA,OAAOA,KAAK,MAAM,OAAO;AACzB,OAAO,iBAAiB;AACxB,OAAOC,WAAW,MAAM,gCAAgC;AACxD,OAAOC,iBAAiB,MAAM,gCAAgC;AAC9D,SAASC,QAAQ,EAAEC,SAAS,QAAQ,OAAO;AAAC,SAAAC,MAAA,IAAAC,OAAA;AAE5C,SAASC,SAASA,CAAA,EAAG;EAAAC,EAAA;EACnB,MAAMC,aAAa,GAAG,CACpB;IACEC,OAAO,EAAE,qBAAqB;IAC9BC,UAAU,EAAE,oDAAoD;IAChEC,OAAO,EAAE;AACf;AACA;AACA;EACI,CAAC,EACD;IACEF,OAAO,EAAE,eAAe;IACxBC,UAAU,EAAE,yCAAyC;IACrDC,OAAO,EAAE;AACf;AACA;AACA;AACA;EACI,CAAC,EACD;IACEF,OAAO,EAAE,gBAAgB;IACzBC,UAAU,EAAE,yDAAyD;IACrEC,OAAO,EAAE;AACf;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;EACI,CAAC,EACD;IACEF,OAAO,EAAE,cAAc;IACvBC,UAAU,EAAE,iCAAiC;IAC7CC,OAAO,EAAE;AACf;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;EACI,CAAC,EACD;IACEF,OAAO,EAAE,QAAQ;IACjBC,UAAU,EAAE,mDAAmD;IAC/DC,OAAO,EAAE;AACf;AACA;AACA;EACI,CAAC,EACD;IACEF,OAAO,EAAE,WAAW;IACpBC,UAAU,EAAE,+CAA+C;IAC3DC,OAAO,EAAE;AACf;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;EACI,CAAC,EACD;IACEF,OAAO,EAAE,kBAAkB;IAC3BC,UAAU,EAAE,4CAA4C;IACxDC,OAAO,EAAE;AACf;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;EACI,CAAC,EACD;IACEF,OAAO,EAAE,aAAa;IACtBC,UAAU,EAAE,yCAAyC;IACrDC,OAAO,EAAE;AACf;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;EACI,CAAC,EACD;IACEF,OAAO,EAAE,iBAAiB;IAC1BC,UAAU,EAAE,oCAAoC;IAChDC,OAAO,EAAE;AACf;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;EACI,CAAC,CACF;;EAED;EACA,MAAK,CAACC,QAAQ,EAAEC,OAAO,CAAC,GAAGX,QAAQ,CAAC,CAAC;EAErCC,SAAS,CAAC,MAAM;IACd,MAAMW,IAAI,GAAGN,aAAa,CAACO,GAAG,CAAC,CAACC,IAAI,EAAEC,KAAK,KAAK,CAAC;MAACC,GAAG,EAAEF,IAAI;MAAEG,GAAG,EAAEF;IAAK,CAAC,CAAC,CAAC;IAC1EG,OAAO,CAACC,GAAG,CAAC,MAAM,EAAEP,IAAI,CAAC;EAC3B,CAAC,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;EAIN,oBACIT,OAAA,CAACL,WAAW;IAAAsB,QAAA,gBACVjB,OAAA;MAAAiB,QAAA,EAAI;IAEJ;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACLrB,OAAA;MAAAiB,QAAA,gBACEjB,OAAA;QAAAiB,QAAA,EAAI;MAA6D;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACtErB,OAAA;QAAAiB,QAAA,EAAG;MAUH;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACD,CAAC,eACNrB,OAAA;MAAKsB,SAAS,EAAC,iBAAiB;MAAAL,QAAA,EAE5Bd,aAAa,CAACO,GAAG,CAAC,CAACC,IAAI,EAAEC,KAAK,kBAC5BZ,OAAA,CAACJ,iBAAiB;QAEhB2B,EAAE,EAAG,WAAUX,KAAM,EAAE;QACvBR,OAAO,EAAEO,IAAI,CAACP,OAAQ;QACtBC,UAAU,EAAEM,IAAI,CAACN,UAAW;QAC5BY,QAAQ,EAAEN,IAAI,CAACL;MAAQ,GAJlBM,KAAK;QAAAM,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAKX,CACH;IAAC;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAEA,CAAC;EAAA;IAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;IAAAC,UAAA;IAAAC,YAAA;EAAA,OACK,CAAC;AAEpB;AAACnB,EAAA,CAtJQD,SAAS;AAAAuB,EAAA,GAATvB,SAAS;AAwJlB,eAAeA,SAAS;AAAC,IAAAuB,EAAA;AAAAC,YAAA,CAAAD,EAAA"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
