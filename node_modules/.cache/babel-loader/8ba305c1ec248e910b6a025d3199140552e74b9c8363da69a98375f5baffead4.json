This puts you in the driver's seat of reclaiming\r\n            and optimizing your health. Your brain is not hard-wired, it is not limited or fixed in it's\r\n            abilities to heal. When the imbalance is removed and brainwaves are regulated, cognitive function\r\n            improves. The result is an improved ability to remember.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className='cards-container'>\r\n          {\r\n            whoWeHelpInfo.map((info, index) =>\r\n              <ExpandableSection\r\n                key={index}\r\n                id={`section-${index}`}\r\n                icon={info.icon}\r\n                heading={info.heading}\r\n                subheading={info.subheading}\r\n                children={info.content}\r\n              />\r\n            )\r\n          }\r\n        </div>\r\n      </FrameLayout>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default WhoWeHelp;\r\n"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAK,MAAM,OAAO;AACzB,OAAO,iBAAiB;AACxB,OAAOC,WAAW,MAAM,gCAAgC;AACxD,OAAOC,iBAAiB,MAAM,gCAAgC;AAC9D,SAASC,OAAO,EAAEC,WAAW,EAAEC,mBAAmB,EAAEC,OAAO,EAAEC,QAAQ,EAAEC,YAAY,EAAEC,WAAW,EAAEC,iBAAiB,QAAQ,mCAAmC;AAAC,SAAAC,MAAA,IAAAC,OAAA;AAE/J,SAASC,SAASA,CAAA,EAAG;EACnB,MAAMC,aAAa,GAAG,CACpB;IACEC,IAAI,EAAEL,iBAAiB;IACvBM,OAAO,EAAE,qBAAqB;IAC9BC,UAAU,EAAE,oDAAoD;IAChEC,OAAO,EAAE;AACf;AACA;AACA;EACI,CAAC,EACD;IACEH,IAAI,EAAEP,YAAY;IAClBQ,OAAO,EAAE,eAAe;IACxBC,UAAU,EAAE,yCAAyC;IACrDC,OAAO,EAAE;AACf;AACA;AACA;AACA;EACI,CAAC,EACD;IACEH,IAAI,EAAEV,mBAAmB;IACzBW,OAAO,EAAE,gBAAgB;IACzBC,UAAU,EAAE,yDAAyD;IACrEC,OAAO,EAAE;AACf;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;EACI,CAAC,EACD;IACEH,IAAI,EAAET,OAAO;IACbU,OAAO,EAAE,cAAc;IACvBC,UAAU,EAAE,iCAAiC;IAC7CC,OAAO,EAAE;AACf;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;EACI,CAAC,EACD;IACEH,IAAI,EAAEN,WAAW;IACjBO,OAAO,EAAE,QAAQ;IACjBC,UAAU,EAAE,mDAAmD;IAC/DC,OAAO,EAAE;AACf;AACA;AACA;EACI,CAAC,EACD;IACEH,IAAI,EAAER,QAAQ;IACdS,OAAO,EAAE,WAAW;IACpBC,UAAU,EAAE,+CAA+C;IAC3DC,OAAO,EAAE;AACf;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;EACI,CAAC,EACD;IACEH,IAAI,EAAEX,WAAW;IACjBY,OAAO,EAAE,kBAAkB;IAC3BC,UAAU,EAAE,4CAA4C;IACxDC,OAAO,EAAE;AACf;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;EACI,CAAC,EACD;IACEH,IAAI,EAAE,EAAE;IACRC,OAAO,EAAE,aAAa;IACtBC,UAAU,EAAE,yCAAyC;IACrDC,OAAO,EAAE;AACf;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;EACI,CAAC,EACD;IACEH,IAAI,EAAEZ,OAAO;IACba,OAAO,EAAE,iBAAiB;IAC1BC,UAAU,EAAE,oCAAoC;IAChDC,OAAO,EAAE;AACf;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;EACI,CAAC,CACF;EAED,oBACIN,OAAA,CAACX,WAAW;IAAAkB,QAAA,gBACVP,OAAA;MAAAO,QAAA,EAAI;IAEJ;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACLX,OAAA;MAAAO,QAAA,gBACEP,OAAA;QAAAO,QAAA,EAAI;MAA6D;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACtEX,OAAA;QAAAO,QAAA,EAAG;MAUH;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACD,CAAC,eACNX,OAAA;MAAKY,SAAS,EAAC,iBAAiB;MAAAL,QAAA,EAE5BL,aAAa,CAACW,GAAG,CAAC,CAACC,IAAI,EAAEC,KAAK,kBAC5Bf,OAAA,CAACV,iBAAiB;QAEhB0B,EAAE,EAAG,WAAUD,KAAM,EAAE;QACvBZ,IAAI,EAAEW,IAAI,CAACX,IAAK;QAChBC,OAAO,EAAEU,IAAI,CAACV,OAAQ;QACtBC,UAAU,EAAES,IAAI,CAACT,UAAW;QAC5BE,QAAQ,EAAEO,IAAI,CAACR;MAAQ,GALlBS,KAAK;QAAAP,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAMX,CACH;IAAC;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAEA,CAAC;EAAA;IAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;IAAAC,UAAA;IAAAC,YAAA;EAAA,OACK,CAAC;AAEpB;AAACM,EAAA,GAtJQhB,SAAS;AAwJlB,eAAeA,SAAS;AAAC,IAAAgB,EAAA;AAAAC,YAAA,CAAAD,EAAA"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
