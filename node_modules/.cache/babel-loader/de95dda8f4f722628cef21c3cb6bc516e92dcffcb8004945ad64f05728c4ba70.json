As a result, most people who suffer from post trauma are looking for\n        an effective way to treat their symptoms so they can get back to living a normal life. Unfortunately,\n        many sufferers experience only limited benefit after trying various therapies and medication. Post trauma\n        is a disorder based in the brain. With post trauma, a severe stress response is triggered, the challenge\n        is to teach the brain to turn off the stress response. Research shows that the traumatic stress experienced\n        by those suffering from post trauma has a lasting change on the brain. It affects the amygdala involved in\n        emotional memory, the hippocampus responsible for long term memory, and prefrontal cortex which modulates\n        emotion. Each of these centers change, negatively impacting brainwave function. Current treatment options\n        include talk therapy and medication but each have their limitations. Talk therapy can take a very long time\n        to resolve the trauma as many suffers aren't always aware of the trauma.

Sleeping issues can disrupt daily life\n        by causing irritability, exhaustion, tiredness, and difficulty staying focused. If being tired\n        all of the time isn't bad enough, this affliction is also believed to be a risk factor for other\n        diseases, including obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Chronic, or recurrent,\n        sleep issues are a widespread condition affecting nearly 10-15% of the global population. The longer\n        you struggle with this, the harder it becomes to treat.
